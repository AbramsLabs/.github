## Hi there 👋

We aim to create apps by the people, for the people with user empowerment as the main focus.

We believe in the super-user and always maintain transparent access to every layer of our apps involving your data.

[NoteBridge](https://notebridge.app/) is our first and most proud application as AbramsLabs Inc., which is built for nerds like ourselves who have a keen interest in midi musical instruments. It is designed to make these devices a part of your every day life, by utilising them as an input device when they're not busy helping you crash that next best beat.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
